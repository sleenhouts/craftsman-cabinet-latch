3D printable front-mounted latch based on one found on a built-in cabinet in a 1909 Craftsman house.

# Hardware needed
2 #5 screws (originals were 1/2" oval wood screws)  
2 #6 screws (originals were 13/20" oval wood screws)  
1 #6 1/4" flat head machine screw  
1 #6-32 hex machine screw nut  
1 1" spring (I used item no. 1986K53 from McMaster-Carr. Up to 0.2" diameter should work.)

# Printing
I got this printed at the library in PLA with 25% infill. Files are not in any particular orientation good for printing. I recommend putting the base on its side.

# Assembly
See [inside.jpg](https://github.com/sleenhouts/craftsman-cabinet-latch/blob/main/inside.jpg) to see how the parts fit together. I put a bit of glue in the hole in the handle before inserting the pusher peg (through the base). You could glue the nut into place or fuse with a soldering iron, but since it'll be held in place once the latch is screwed on the door I didn't bother.
